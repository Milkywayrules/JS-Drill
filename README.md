# JS-Drill

Another repo just for my personal exercise (drill). Learning ES5, ES6, ES7, and many more about front-end tech stack. This repo only contains the basic front-end tech, I'll not add any framework or fancy stuffs here I guess. Fancy stuff like Typescript and framework/lib like React, Vue, Next, Nuxt, some ORM libs, GraphQL, and others are stored in another repo.  

Check my JS-Drill-Advanced repo [here](https://github.com/Milkywayrules/JS-Drill-Advanced).  

Maybe i'll add some Vue, React, and TypeScript content in the future, take your time and wait. lol.
